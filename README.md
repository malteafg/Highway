https://trello.com/b/5XTbD0qW/highway-architect

## Readable code
- Always write return types on defs
- Let vars and vals have names of at least three letters unless used in a simple structure (as an iterator or in a fold for instance)
- Always add empty parenthesis such as to distinguish between defs and vars/vals unless accessor def
- Use _ instead of null when first initializing
- Don't call an Array array, call it what it is
